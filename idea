Trading bot block code Ideas

- Audience: 
    - Retail investors, traders, hobbyists, and developers interested in algorithmic trading.

- Web application:
    - Accessible via browser, no installation required.
    - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

- Core Workflow:
    - From fetching OHLCV of specified stocks to simulated or real trade executions in user accounts.
    - Modular, block-based approach: users build bots by connecting functional blocks.

- Block Types:

    - Data Fetching Block
        - Fetch OHLCV (and optionally historical) data using Yahoo Finance yfinance API for all assets in tradable universe.
        - Store data in server-side database (e.g., SQLite/PostgreSQL) to build a historical data cache.
        - Implement API calls to the server.
        - Specify interval and asset parameters.
        - Option to fetch historical data of capped length (e.g., last month).
        - Handle rate limits and retries.
        - Support inference and AI model training options for data fetch.
        - News fetching option (e.g., using News API or similar service).
        - Social sentiment data integration (e.g., Twitter, Reddit).

    - Data Processing Block
        - Process fetched data to prepare it for analysis.
        - Clean and normalize data.
        - Handle missing values and outliers.
        - Resample data if necessary (e.g., from minute to daily).
        - Merge multiple data sources (e.g., price, news, sentiment).

    - Indicator/Signal/Feature Calculation Block
        - Calculate technical indicators (e.g., EMA, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands) using TA-Lib or custom implementations.
        - Feature engineering for ML models (e.g., lagged returns, volatility).
        - Allow users to define custom indicators.

    - Strategy Block
        - Define trading strategies (e.g., crossover, momentum, mean reversion).
        - Implement logic for entry and exit signals based on indicators.
        - Support multi-factor and multi-asset strategies.
        - Allow scripting for advanced users (e.g., JavaScript or Python).

    - AI/ML Block
        - Integrate machine learning models for predictive analytics (e.g., price forecasting, anomaly detection).
        - Allow users to train custom models on historical data.
        - Provide pre-built models for common trading strategies.
        - LLM (Large Language Model) option for natural language strategy definition.
        - Support for reinforcement learning agents.

    - Risk Management Block
        - Implement risk management rules (e.g., stop-loss, take-profit, trailing stops).
        - Set position sizing based on user-defined parameters (e.g., Kelly criterion, fixed fractional).
        - Portfolio-level risk controls (e.g., max drawdown, volatility targeting).
        - Compliance checks (e.g., pattern day trading, wash sale rule).

    - Order Execution Block
        - Handle order types (e.g., market, limit, stop).
        - Implement slippage and fill logic.
        - Simulate order book and liquidity for realistic backtesting.
        - Real broker API integration (for live trading).

    - Execution Block
        - Simulate buy/sell orders using a paper portfolio (deduct money when stock is purchased, add money when stock is sold).
        - Track cash, positions, and P&L in real time.
        - Support multiple portfolios per user.

    - Monitoring Block
        - Log trades (removes unnecessary API calls to bank trading platforms).
        - Track performance metrics (e.g., win rate, profit factor, Sharpe ratio, drawdown).
        - Implement message/alert system for significant events (e.g., stop-loss hit, new trade signal).
        - Real-time monitoring dashboard.

    - Visualization Block
        - Display trade history and performance statistics.
        - Provide real-time updates on open positions and portfolio value.
        - Interactive charts (e.g., candlestick, equity curve, drawdown).
        - Customizable dashboards and widgets.
